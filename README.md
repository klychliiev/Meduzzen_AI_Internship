# <b> Meduzzen & U2D AI Internship </b><br>
## Projects Overview 
I'd like to try my hand at all three challenges (NLP, email classification/extraction and object detection), but as a computational limguistics student I am particulary interested in NLP.
### NLP <br>

Below is the list of Python modules I use in my work as a computational linguist. However, not all of them fit our requirements for this Internship, particularly, due to the limited number of supported languages.

Useful libraries for tackling NLP problems:

| <center>library  | <center> description  | <center> fits our needs |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| stanza  | Collection of tools for the linguistic analysis created by the Stanford NLP team. Supports multiple languages. For example, for NER task, stanza has pre-trained models for 34 languages.   | :white_check_mark: | 
| SpaCy  | Powerful Python NLP library with support for 70+ languages. It has in-built word vectors, has tools for tokenization, NER, POS-tagging, dependancy parsing, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis etc. | :white_check_mark:  |   
| pymorphy2  | Morpohlogical analyser written in Python. It is used for fetching information about grammatical properties of a particular word (POS, case, gender, number). Supports only two languages: Ukrainian and Russian. | :no_entry:  |     
| gensim  | Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. | :white_check_mark: |      
| fasttext  | Useful Python library for working with word embeddings. Contains pre-trained word vectors for 157 (!) languages.  | :white_check_mark: |    
| langdetect  | Niche Python library designed exclusively for the language detection task. Able to detect 55 languages. | :white_check_mark: |   
| Polyglot  | Polyglot supports various multilingual applications and offers a wide range of analysis. Applications: language detection, tokenization, NER, POS-tagginf, sentiment analysis. | :white_check_mark:  |   
| nltk  | Suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical NLP for English written in the Python programming language. | :no_entry: |
