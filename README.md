# <b> Meduzzen & U2D AI Internship </b><br>
## Projects Overview 
I'd like to try my hand at all three challenges (NLP, email classification/extraction and object detection), but as a computational limguistics student I am particularly interested in NLP.
### :speaking_head: NLP <br>

Below is the list of Python modules I use in my work as a computational linguist. However, not all of them fit our requirements for this Internship, particularly, due to the limited number of supported languages.

Useful libraries for tackling NLP problems:

| <center>library  | <center> description  | <center> fits our needs |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| stanza  | Collection of tools for the linguistic analysis created by the Stanford NLP team. Supports multiple languages. For example, for NER task, stanza has pre-trained models for 34 languages.   | :white_check_mark: | 
| SpaCy  | Powerful Python NLP library with support for 70+ languages. It has in-built word vectors, has tools for tokenization, NER, POS-tagging, dependancy parsing, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis etc. | :white_check_mark:  |   
| pymorphy2  | Morpohlogical analyser written in Python. It is used for fetching information about grammatical properties of a particular word (POS, case, gender, number). Supports only two languages: Ukrainian and Russian. | :no_entry:  |     
| gensim  | Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. | :white_check_mark: |      
| fasttext  | Useful Python library for working with word embeddings. Contains pre-trained word vectors for 157 (!) languages.  | :white_check_mark: |    
| langdetect  | Niche Python library designed exclusively for the language detection task. Able to detect 55 languages. | :white_check_mark: |   
| Polyglot  | Polyglot supports various multilingual applications and offers a wide range of analysis. Applications: language detection, tokenization, NER, POS-tagginf, sentiment analysis. | :white_check_mark:  |   
| nltk  | Suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical NLP for English written in the Python programming language. | :no_entry: |   

### :love_letter: Emails classification

Working on tasks related to email classification and extraction, we deal with the text data in the first place, therefore, libraries listed in the NLP section will come in handy. For emails classification we can use sklearn and tensorflow/keras libraries.

### :video_camera: Object Detection (CV)

Useful Python packages for image & video data processing:

|library   | description  | fits our needs  |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| OpenCv  | CV library focused on real-time applications. The library has a modular structure and includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. | :white_check_mark: |
| Scikit-Image | Includes a collection of algorithms for image processing. Image processing toolbox for SciPy. | :white_check_mark:  |
| Matplotlib | Library for creating static, animated and interactive visualisations. | :white_check_mark:  |
| Pillow | Contains all the basic image processing functionality; intuitive and easy-to-use. | :white_check_mark:  |
| numpy | While not being a specifically CV library, numpy provides powerful data structures and algorithms for easy image data manipulation. | :white_check_mark:  |
