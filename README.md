Projects Overview 

NLP <br>

As a computational linguistics student, I am passionate about NLP and would like to participate in the NLP challenge. <br>
Below is the list of Python modules I use in my work. However, not all of them fit our requirements for this Internship, particularly, due to the limited number of supported languages.

Useful libraries for tackling NLP problems:

| library  | description  | fits our needs  | 
|---|---|---|
| stanza  | Collectiob of tools for the linguistic analysis created by the Stanford NLP team. Supports multiple languages, for example, for NER task, stanza has models for 34 languages.   | :white_check_mark: | 
| SpaCy  | Powerful Python NLP library with support for 70+ languages. It has in-built word vectors, has tools for tokenization, NER, POS-tagging, dependancy parsing, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis etc. | :white_check_mark:  |   
| pymorphy2  | Pymorphy2 is a morpohlogical analyser writte in Python. It is used for fetching information about grammatical properties of a particular word (POS, case, gender, number). Supports only two languages: Ukrainian and Russian. | :no_entry:  |     
| gensim  |  Gensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. | :white_check_mark: |      
| fasttext  | Useful Python library for word embeddings. Contains pre-trained word vectors for 157 (!) languages.  |   |    
| langdetect  | Niche Python library exclusively for language detection. Detecs texts written in 55 languages. | :white_check_mark: |   
| Polyglot  | Polyglot supports various multilingual applications and offers a wide range of analysis. Applications: language detection, tokenization, NER, POS-tagginf, sentiment analysis. | :white_check_mark:  |
